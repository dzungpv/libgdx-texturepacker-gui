# Libgdx TexturePacker Gui

The libgdx-texturepacker-gui is, as says its name, a GUI for the awesome texture packer that comes with every libgdx distribution.

I strongly recommend you to have a look to the following page for instructions on how the libgdx texture packer works: https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/Texture-packer

Support Windows/Mac/Linux, Java 1.7 require

The project was created on Apr 4, 2011.
